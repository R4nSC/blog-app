# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.

## Why Next.js?

- **Server-side Rendering**: Improves performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation**: Pre-renders pages at build time
- **API Routes**: Create API endpoints as part of your Next.js app
- **File-based Routing**: Create routes based on your file structure
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Use CSS Modules, Sass, or other styling solutions

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js app, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will create a new Next.js app in the `my-app` directory.
