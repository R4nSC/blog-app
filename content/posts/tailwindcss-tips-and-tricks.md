# TailwindCSS Tips and Tricks

TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without leaving your HTML.

## Tip 1: Use the @apply Directive

If you find yourself repeating the same utility classes over and over, consider extracting them into a CSS class using the `@apply` directive.

```css
/* In your CSS file */
.btn {
  @apply py-2 px-4 bg-blue-500 text-white font-semibold rounded-lg shadow-md hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-400 focus:ring-opacity-75;
}
```

## Tip 2: Use the JIT Mode

Tailwind's Just-in-Time (JIT) mode generates your styles on-demand as you author your templates instead of generating everything in advance at initial build time.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  // ...
}
```

## Tip 3: Customize Your Theme

Tailwind makes it easy to customize your design system by editing the `tailwind.config.js` file.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'brand': '#3490dc',
      },
      spacing: {
        '72': '18rem',
        '84': '21rem',
        '96': '24rem',
      }
    }
  }
}
```
